# frontendtest

This is a sample application using Angular, NgRx and Angular Material to show a simple shopping cart with some fake product data.

The current functionality is as follows:

- Display list of catalog items
- Button to add items to cart
- Shopping cart showing items in the cart and their respective counts
- Ability to increment / decrement count of items in your cart

# New feature request

A new feature has been requested to allow for users to remove all of a particular item from their cart.

Given I have some items in my cart
When I press the trash button
Then all of the items of that kind are removed from my cart
